    "changelog": "- QuickApp struggled with users without energy production. Solved that bug. <br /> Version 4.0: <br />- Added Tibber Production values to the labels.  <br />- Added Production Child devices for:  <br /> - Hour-1 Production (production of the previous hour) <br />- Daily Production (production in kWh) <br />- Monthly Production (production in kWh) <br />- Yearly Production (production in kWh) <br />- Total Production (production in kWh, devicetype com.fibaro.energyMeter and automatic rateType=production for Fibaro Energy Panel) <br />- Added buttons to filter the labels in Prices, Prices Today, Prices Tomorrow, Consumption, Production and Reset (show all label content).  <br />- Added nice graphs for today and tomorrow prices with the ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸª colors.  <br />- Added nice graphs for energy consumption and production with ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ© colors.  <br />- Added QuickApp variable to enable Energy Zero gas prices.  <br />- Changed the Global Variables percentage to number, so there in no more double quote (''). Please check your scenes if they need any changes! <br />- Changed the main device to multilevel sensor that shows the current price and level.  <br />- Changed QuickApp variable token to secret (stored encrypted) for maximum security.  <br />- Added maximum retries, with exponential backoff and jitter to Tibber API requests. If there is any issue with the connection, the QuickApp will retry some times and if the issue still exists, the QuickApp will disconnect. You will get a notification on your Tibber iOS or Android app. You can re-connect the QuickApp by clicking on the main device.  <br />- Added extra check for status 'awaiting market'. The QuickApp stops working and the user get an warning message in the debug logging and a message in the labels.  <br />- Improved the handling of a wrong Home Number. The QuickApp stops working and the user get an error message in the debug logging and a message in the labels.  <br />- Added check for new QuickApp version.  <br />- Added more functions for disable quickapp. If the QuickApp is disabled, now also the buttons and fibaro calls are disabled.  <br />- Added a function to handle dynamic GraphQL Queries or Mutations (from user input with a scene): QuickApp:executeCustomGraphQL(query). The response can be seen in the debug logging.  <br />- Solved a bug, the average tomorrow price didn't go to zero, when the tomorrow prices aren't yet available.  <br />- Removed Simulation Mode. If you don't have a working token, you could use a test token from Tibber.  <br />"

    "changelog": "- Added child for Accumulated Reward (todays reward for energy production).  <br />- Added child for Net Profit (todays reward for energy production minus todays cost for energy consumption).  <br />- Added more functions to fully disable the quickapp. If the QuickApp is disabled by the user, now also the buttons and fibaro calls are disabled. <br />- Added buttons to disconnect and connect webSocket session.  <br />- Changed the behaviour of connecting to the Tibber WebSocket. After the maximum reconnects (10), the QuickApp disconnects and sends a notification to the Tibber iOS or Android app. The Tibber user gets better informed and can take action.  <br />- Removed the reconnect QuickApp variable, not necessary to get changed by the Tibber user, it is now hardcoded (and the value is still 10 reconnects).  <br />- Added check if realtime consumption (Tibber Pulse is working) is enabled at startup of the QuickApp and when reconnecting the QuickApp. If the Tibber Pulse is not available, not working, then the QuickApp will go in disconnected status and in the labels the Tibber user can see the reason.  <br />- Added Net Profit (todays reward for energy production minus todays cost for energy consumption) to the labels.  <br />- Placed the average power consumption (Watt) more prominent in the labels.  <br />- Added Tibber Server responses to the labels (they were already in de debuglogging) so the Tibber users gets better informed about the connection status.  <br />- Added the check for a new QuickApp version. The user gets notified in the Fibaro Notifications of the new QuickApp with the changelog.  <br />- Changed the debuglevels a bit, so you can see the connection statusses already in debuglevel 2.  <br />- Changed QuickApp variabels 'token' and 'homeId' to secret (stored encrypted) so they cannot get shown or published unintentionally.  <br />- Added dynamic Tibber Live webSocket URL (at startup the QuickApp gets the current webSocket URL), so the QuickApp is future proof in case the WebSocket URL gets changed.  <br />- Removed both simulation modes (debugLevel 4 and 5).  <br />"
